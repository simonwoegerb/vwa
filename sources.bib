abstract = {In the recent studies additive manufacturing technology prove their importance in every field because of its accessibility increases as the earlier patents expired which gives an opportunity to the manufacturers to develop different types of 3D printing devices as per need. There are different types of material available in the market and for every type of material we need an additive manufacturing method to print these materials layer by layer on top of each other by using 3D CAD models (Mazzanti et al., 2019). In this paper we discusses wide range of materials in details with respective 3D printing techniques. Further materials which are most commonly used such as polymers, metals and alloys, composites, concrete, ceramics to the materials which are under development stages such as biomaterials, food printing materials, smart materials, glass, resin and wood are discussed in detail with their respective 3D printing methods. The scope of 3D printing in the suggested areas are concluded.}

abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) based on Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) and Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is relatively widely used to manufacture complex shape parts made from metallic alloys, ceramic and polymers. One of the main problems is to guarantee surface quality of the manufactured product. This study investigated the effects of various SLS/SLM parameters such as the laser power, scanning speed, hatching, powder layer thickness and volumetric energy density on the surface roughness, porosity and material density of samples made from the CoCr powder. A mathematical model for the average surface roughness Ra based on the machining parameters and important thermo physical properties was established using the dimensional analysis. The results of this study show the significance of the correlation between the material density of the built part and its surface roughness.}
